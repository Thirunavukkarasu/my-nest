/**
 * API Integration Tests
 * Run all API tests together
 * 
 * Note: Vitest automatically discovers and runs all test files.
 * This file is kept for potential integration test scenarios.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Do NOT import other test files here - Vitest auto-discovers them.
 * Importing them causes tests to run twice (once directly, once through imports).
